        <div class="content w-richtext">
          <p>We are a leading Washington DC&nbsp;video production company, and we've helped several businesses grow their engagement through explainer videos and explainer video animation.</p>
          <p>Every explainer video we create contains 3 key components:</p>
          <ol start="" role="list">
            <li><strong>A clear message</strong>. The main purpose of an explainer video is to convey a single idea or concept in an entertaining way. Your message should be short, direct, engaging, and memorable.</li>
            <li><strong>A creative concept.</strong> A good explainer video will make people smile, laugh or think differently about the product or service that you're offering. It should also make them want to learn more about what you have to offer by engaging their curiosity while remaining informative at the same time.</li>
            <li><strong>The right tone.</strong> The tone of your explainer video should match the audience that you're targeting as well as your brand identity. Your video should be fun but not cheesy, helpful but not boring, and informative but not condescending.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>View some example explainer videos we've created below.</p>

        <div class="content mb20 w-richtext">
          <p>Kindred Youth Ministry is another business that was able to leverage the power of the explainer video extremely well.</p>
          <p>This video was created to help market a free PDF&nbsp;guide that Kindred was using to gain new leads. The places the video was used included the sales page, social media, and advertising.</p>
          <p>We used animation and voiceover narration to make the video more engaging than simply reading text onscreen. This approach also allowed us to illustrate the key benefits of the PDF&nbsp;in a way that viewers could understand quickly and easily. The human brain connects with pictures and stories —&nbsp;of which the explainer video has both.</p>
          <p>The result was an animated explainer video that was viewed thousands and thousands of times, and generated many new leads and new customers for Kindred.</p>

        <h2 class="heading h2">How to find and select the right video production company</h2>
        <div class="content w-richtext">
          <p>Okay —&nbsp;you're ready to create a killer explainer video for your company's product or service. What do you look for when thinking about who to hire?&nbsp;Here are a few factors to consider:</p>
          <h3>Marketing Insight</h3>
          <p>When you invest in an explainer video, you're not really paying for the explainer video. You're investing in the results it will achieve for your business's marketing strategy. </p>
          <p>So the question is, does the video production company have experience and insight into how the video will fit into your overall marketing and communications pipeline?</p>
          <p>At Secretariat, we have background in marketing, communications, and sales. We leverage the knowledge and experience we've gained in those fields, and our understanding of buyer psychology and customer personas, to produce video work for you that excels in each of these areas.</p>
          <h3>Production Quality</h3>
          <p>Let's face it: there are many people online offering to create an explainer video for you. However, with most of these online services, you get what you pay for.</p>
          <p>At Secretariat, our team of creative minds are ready to create a good impression for your brand through every video we make for you. Our standard for our videos is only the highest level of production quality. We take pride in our work, and we want that to show in the video — for you and for your customers.</p>
          <h3>Communication</h3>
          <p>Communication is key when working with a business partner who will be working on such an important aspect of your marketing strategy. </p>
          <p>That's why it's our promise that you will be kept up-to-date at all times throughout the process of each video production.</p>

        </div>
        <h2 class="heading h2">What the process looks like</h2>
        <div class="content w-richtext">
          <h3>1. Get to know you and your business.</h3>
          <p>We'll spend time getting to know you and your business, so we can better understand how to best communicate your message. Some important elements here include your brand's mission and vision, your marketing strategy, and your campaign objectives and KPIs.</p>
          <h3>2. Market research.</h3>
          <p>For each new client, we do extensive online research on their industry, competitors, and customers. This gives us a solid understanding of the current climate and what our tone and messaging should be. This is all done in communication with you to ensure we work together and are on the same page.</p>
          <h3>3. Write a script. </h3>
          <p>Once we have a good understanding of the situation, we'll create a script that communicates the key messages needed by your audience.</p>
          <p>We’ll work with you to create a script that brings the message to life in an engaging way. We also have the option to create storyboards for each scene of the video and make revisions along the way.</p>
          <h3>4. Voiceover.</h3>
          <p>We'll produce your video using professional voiceover talent that matches the tone needed for your audience.</p>
          <h3>5. Animate and produce the video.</h3>
          <p>We edit the voiceover and visuals together into a finished product that we then work with you on to incorporate any necessary revisions.</p>

        <h2 class="heading h2">Explainer video&nbsp;FAQs</h2>
        <div class="content w-richtext">
          <h3>How much do explainer videos cost?</h3>
          <p>The short answer is, it depends. Some factors include the level of production time, the length of the script, the number of visuals, and the content of the video (how much time it will take to animate). With all these factors, it's impossible to give an estimate without knowing details of the project. </p>
          <h3>How long should an explainer video be?</h3>
          <p>The ideal length is 1-3 minutes. It can be shorter or longer depending on the content, but the general rule is to keep it under 3-4 minutes to keep the audience's interest and attention.</p>
          <h3>How long will the project take?</h3>
          <p>This also depends on the project scope and all the details involved. Through talking with you and your team, we can give you an estimate of project production time. Before every project, we provide a full, detailed timeline with milestones to keep both us and you on the same page throughout the process.</p>
          <h3>Where should we use the explainer video?</h3>
          <p>Explainer videos are useful for your website, whether the homepage or a detail page for your product or service. They are also great for social media, whether organic or paid. Before the project, we discuss with you your intended output channels and audience for the video, so we can tailor the video to fit perfectly with your marketing efforts.</p>
