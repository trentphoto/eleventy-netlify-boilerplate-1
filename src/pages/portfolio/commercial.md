        <h2 class="heading h2">Why should your organization use a commercial video?</h2>
        <div class="content w-richtext">
          <p>Video is the most straightforward way to get your message across to your target audience. </p>
          <p>Marketers spend a significant amount of their budget on video advertising —&nbsp;in fact, it's estimated that most marketing budgets spend at least 25% on video. </p>
          <p>Why? Because videos are one of the best mediums for communication. But not all videos are created equal.</p>
          <p>A good video production company can craft a great story that inspires and motivates your target audience.</p>

        <div class="content mb20 w-richtext">
          <p>We worked with HelpMeSellNow (HMSN) to produce a commercial video that would get their message in front of their target audience.</p>
          <p>The goal was to create an engaging, informative piece that could be used for social media and web content, as well as for advertising purposes.</p>
          <p>We started by developing a script that fit with the tone and personality of the business. Then we went into production mode, completing shooting in just a few short days. We used high-quality lighting and camera equipment from Canon as well as professional audio production equipment to ensure a crystal-clear sound.</p>
          <p>When it came time for editing, we worked with HMSN to make sure the edit reflected what they were looking for in the video.</p>
          <p>In addition to creating an engaging video that helped get this company's message in front of its target audience, our team also provided them with additional clips and footage to help market their message on social media and the web.</p>

        <h2 class="heading h2">How to find and select the right commercial video production company</h2>
        <div class="content w-richtext">
          <p>Ready to use video to drive results for your marketing strategy? Here are some considerations to keep in mind.</p>
          <h3>1. Messaging</h3>
          <p>To connect well with your audience, the video should be useful, entertaining, and engaging. We'll work with you to develop a script, storyline, and messaging that your audience will connect with.</p>
          <h3>2. Less is more.</h3>
          <p>Keep it short and sweet. Unless you have a good reason to create a 10-minute video — best to keep it under 3-4 minutes to keep your audience engaged.</p>
          <p>We'll work with you to develop a storyboard and blocking draft, so all the content and script of your video is planned out in advance. This will help your marketing team, too, as you can plan for the release and promotion of the video once it's complete.</p>
          <h3>3. Production Quality.</h3>
          <p>You need a level of production quality that will match the image your organization wants to have in front of your target audience. At Secretariat, we've been producing videos for over 10 years, utilizing state-of-the-art equipment, and we have the technical expertise to make your video the highest quality.</p>

          <p>Ready to create an incredible video that engages your audience and tells your brand's story?</p>

        <h2 class="heading h2">What the process looks like</h2>
        <div class="content w-richtext">
          <p>Commercial video production is a complex process. There are many aspects to consider and plan for, from storyboarding and casting to on-location filming and editing.</p>
          <p>Here's what the process looks like to create a killer promotional video for your organization.</p>
          <h3>1. Planning and storyboarding</h3>
          <p>The first step in creating a killer promotional video is to plan the entire process. This is where we'll nail down messaging, audience, and the tone of the video. Once those are decided, we can start planning out the storyboarding process.</p>
          <p>We'll meet with you to brainstorm all the important details. We'll also make sure during the planning process that we allocate all the resources we need, such as production time, locations, equipment, talent/actors, and production staff, in order to make this the project a massive success.</p>
          <h3>2. Filming</h3>
          <p>Once we have an approved storyboard, it's time for us to start filming. This is where all the magic happens. The director will ensure every person on set knows their role, where to be and when, so the entire shooting process will run smoothly. </p>
          <p>Depending on the video, we also typically will ensure we get a variety of types of shots:&nbsp;close up, medium, wide, panning, dolly, and time lapse shots, just to name a few. Of course, each shot will have been planned out and approved in Phase 1, making the filming process that much more simple.</p>
          <h3>3. Postproduction</h3>
          <p>Next, we take all of our footage and craft a cohesive narrative that tells your story in an engaging way. We'll also incorporate any graphics and music to really make the video shine. The goal of this phase is to create a finished product that meets our client's needs.</p>
          <h3>4) Delivery and Distribution</h3>
          <p>Once everything is ready, it's time to get the message out to the world. We'll work with you to make sure the video meets all requirements for distribution and work with your marketing team to provide any formats and specs that are needed.</p>

        <h2 class="heading h2">Commercial Video&nbsp;FAQs</h2>
        <div class="content w-richtext">
          <h3>How long should the video be?</h3>
          <p>As a general rule, typically it should be under 3-4 minutes in length. However, there are cases in which creating a longer video, even 10 minutes in length or more, can make sense for your business.</p>
          <h3>How long does the project take from start to finish?</h3>
          <p>It depends on several factors such as how long your script is and how many people are involved in the production process. For a short and simple project, can be as short as a few weeks or less. During the planning phase, we will map out the project timeline together to give you a realistic understanding of what to expect.</p>
          <h3>Do we need actors?</h3>
          <p>It depends on the video concept and script —&nbsp;but we often use actors or other paid talent to be able to take the video to the next level. If we do need actors, we have networks we source talent from, and we are always open to using talent you provide as well.</p>
          <h3>How much will the project cost?</h3>
          <p>Pricing depends on many factors, primarily project scope — the level of production and work the project will involve. We also take into account things like the length of the video and how much time we'll need to shoot and edit it. We also factor in the equipment needed, the talent that will be involved, and any other services that are required for the project (like animation or VFX).</p>
