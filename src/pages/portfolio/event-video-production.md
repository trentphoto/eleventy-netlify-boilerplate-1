        <h2 class="heading h2">Why Event Video Is Vital for your Organization</h2>
        <div class="content w-richtext">
          <h3>Why create a promo video?</h3>
          <p>If you've ever been to an event, you know that events are not just about the event itself. It's also about the pre-event excitement and buzz.</p>
          <p>With this in mind, it's important to have a promo video for your organization's event or conference. A promo video is what will be used to generate interest in your event. It can be used on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, as well as YouTube.</p>
          <p>There are many benefits to having a promo video for your event:</p>
          <ol start="" role="list">
            <li>Increased awareness about the event</li>
            <li>Better conversion rates from website visitors into attendees</li>
            <li>Give your audience an idea of what they can expect for the event</li>
            <li>Build excitement by showing featured guests or keynote speakers</li>
            <li>Building overall brand awareness</li>
          </ol>
          <p>An event promo video is so flexible in marketing and advertising leading up to the event - there's so much you can do with it.</p>
          <h3>How filming keynotes and presentations at your event can help your organization</h3>
          <p>As you're looking to become an industry leader or build your brand, one crucial aspect of your marketing efforts is <strong>video</strong>. In addition, content marketing and repurposing content can help multiply your efforts to reach even more people.</p>
          <p>What better way to create video content than to document and repurpose content you've already worked to create, through filming the presentations at your event?</p>
          <p>In addition to marketing, video can also be used for training purposes.</p>
          <p>But it's not as simple as just setting up a phone or camera. When filming a presentation or keynote address, having professional equipment, lighting, sound quality, and postproduction can make all the difference in how it looks and how much you're able to use it going forward.</p>
          <h3>Why live stream your event?</h3>
          <p>Live-streaming an event is one of the best ways to engage with your audience and create a memorable experience. There are so many benefits of live-streaming your organization's event: it creates a real-time connection with your audience, it can help increase audience participation and drives more engaged traffic to your website, it can help increase brand awareness, and so much more.</p>
          <p>It can also help increase viewership: Live streaming allows anyone with internet access to watch the event at any time of day or night – even if they are unable to attend in person! People who couldn’t make it out will be able to follow along from their own homes or offices, building buzz around the event far beyond what would happen if there were no live stream available at all.</p>
          <p>Needless to say, live video is an incredibly powerful medium for engaging with your audience online.</p>

        <h2 class="heading h2">How to find and select the right video production company for your upcoming event</h2>
        <div class="content w-richtext">
          <p>Okay,&nbsp;so your organization is preparing for an event or conference, and you want to incorporate video. Whether it's a promo video, live stream, or anything in between, it's important to hire the right video production company. What do you look for when thinking about who to hire?&nbsp;Here are a few factors to consider.</p>
          <h3>Experience with live events</h3>
          <p>At Secretariat, live event video production is our specialty (we do commercial wedding cinematography as well). We know what it takes to make every aspect of event video go smoothly without a hitch. Most importantly, we know what to think through, discuss, and prepare for ahead of time, so you know exactly what to expect during the event and for the final product.</p>
          <h3>Marketing Know-How</h3>
          <p>The content from presentations at your event can be used for so much in your content strategy —&nbsp;whether that's blog posts, youtube videos, or social media marketing.</p>
          <p>We have the experience and understanding to work with you to help craft the perfect content strategy, tailoring the videos we produce to fit your needs perfectly.</p>
          <h3>Production Quality</h3>
          <p>At Secretariat, our state-of-the-art equipment and thoroughly-trained staff will help achieve the highest level of production quality. We are experienced with providing multiple camera angles of each speaker, even during simultaneous breakout sessions. </p>
          <h3>Communication</h3>
          <p>When choosing a video production company, it is important to select one that can communicate clearly and effectively. </p>
          <p>First, we meet together to make sure we clearly understand your goals and objectives for the project. Once we are on the same page, only then do we move forward with preproduction and planning the project.</p>
          <p>We make sure you are involved and kept up to speed in every stage of preproduction, shooting, and postproduction workflow. </p>

        <h2 class="heading h2">What the process looks like</h2>
        <div class="content w-richtext">
          <p>Event video production is a complex and involved process. There are many moving parts, and the process must be carefully managed to ensure that all the elements come together seamlessly. Despite all the work planning — the end result is always worth it!</p>
          <p>Here's what our event video production process looks like:</p>
          <h3>1. Planning</h3>
          <p>This involves understanding your video needs and vision for the event. We'll meet together, one or more times, to help us get on the same page regarding what the final product will look like.</p>
          <h3>2. Pre-Event Coverage</h3>
          <p>Before the event, we'll determine the best equipment setup (including camera and lighting) and placement for each camera and microphone. We'll also scout locations to determine shooting angles and find ways to make your space look its best on camera.</p>
          <h3>3. On-Site Production</h3>
          <p>This can involve a wide range of moving parts, including:</p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>Filming keynotes and breakout presentations</li>
            <li>Interviews with speakers or vendors </li>
            <li>B-roll footage of the venue, surrounding area, attendees enjoying themselves, and overall atmosphere</li>
            <li>Audio capture (interviews, ambient sounds)</li>
            <li>Live streaming</li>
            <li>Filming a direct message from a speaker or a representative from your organization (for example, a welcome message, or an intro for those watching online)</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>4. Post-Event Editing</h3>
          <p>Once we're back in our studio, we'll edit all footage in the ways we discussed in stage 1. You'll be involved in every stage of the editing process to make sure the product matches your vision. The final product is delivered via digital download or flash drive, depending on size and intended end use.</p>

        <div class="content w-richtext">
          <h3>What's the difference between live streaming and on-site recording?</h3>
          <p>If your organization's event will be live and in-person, but you want a way for people to attend online as well, live-streaming production will be needed. However, if the event is in-person only or already being streamed online, but you want a way to capture each presentation in archival quality for purposes such as content marketing, social media, and viewing later on, on-site recording will be needed.</p>
          <p>We can also record footage on-site for something like a video message during the event or a promo video for next year's event.</p>
          <h3>How many people will be filming?</h3>
          <p>Depending on the scope of the event, we may have just 1-3 crew members, or we could have several more crew members if multiple sessions need to be filmed simultaneously.</p>
          <h3>What information does the video production team need?</h3>
          <p>We will meet together during the planning phase and go through a step-by-step checklist of everything we need from you to prepare for your event. Some of these things include information about the venue, day-of schedule, activities, and more.</p>
          <h3>How long will the editing process take?</h3>
          <p>This also depends on the scope of the project, how many sessions are taking place, and what the final product will look like. We'll give you an estimate before beginning the project.</p>
          <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
          <p>Project pricing will depend on several factors including the size of your event, how many and what type of videos are needed, how many crew members and what kind of equipment will be needed, and the overall scope of the project. Contact us today and we can give you an estimate after learning more about your event and specific needs.</p>
          <h3>Do you offer free consultations?</h3>
          <p>Of course! Reach out to us today and let's talk.</p>
